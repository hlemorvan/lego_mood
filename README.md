Prepare BrickPi :
We have two BrickPi : One with a RaspBerry Pi 2 and an other one with a RaspBerry Pi 3.
The RaspBerry Pi 3 has also a Raspberry Pi 3.5‚Äù Touch Screen like this one : http://osoyoo.com/2016/05/26/osoyoo-lcd-touch-screen-for-raspberry-pi-installation-guide/
This LCD is provided without sources so you have to take their linux distribution.
